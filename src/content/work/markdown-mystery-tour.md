### Description of the application:

As part of this group project, we developed a web application with a server-side architecture using Django and a client-side setup based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The teamwork was organized using Trello to ensure an efficient distribution of tasks. The application allows users to log in with a username and password, and it features three main interfaces. The first two are designed for professors and administrators, enabling them to add or remove students, manage grades, download reports, and generate detailed graphs and statistics. The third interface is for students, allowing them to view their grades, absences with corresponding dates, as well as their personal statistics.

In line with eco-friendly design principles, we incorporated several responsible features. The application defaults to a dark theme to reduce screen energy consumption, and it operates only from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. to optimize resource usage. Additionally, eco-friendly tips are displayed at the bottom right of each interface to encourage users to adopt more sustainable habits.
