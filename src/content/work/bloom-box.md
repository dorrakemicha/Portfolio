The electronic health record (EHR) is a digital system designed to store, structure, and manage a patientâ€™s medical information. It is gradually replacing traditional paper-based medical records and offers numerous advantages in terms of accessibility, data sharing, and security. Additionally, it aims to help patients adapt to the digitalization of healthcare, making it easier for them to receive accurate diagnoses and monitor their clinical condition.

Due to significant data loss, which often leads to incorrect diagnoses and inappropriate treatments, we found it crucial to develop an application that organizes and structures these processes to improve the healthcare sector. This application will also facilitate the secure sharing of medical records among various healthcare professionals and institutions, while ensuring optimal management of user access rights.

We developed our mobile application using Flutter and Firebase technologies. In the next development phase, we plan to standardize data exchanges by integrating the Hapi FHIR server and the OpenMRS medical database.
