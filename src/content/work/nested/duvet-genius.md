Rectangle Drawer is a software application designed to allow users to intuitively create and manipulate rectangles. With this tool, users can draw rectangles, dynamically move them across the interface, change their colors, and resize them as needed. An advanced feature also enables the calculation of geometric operations, such as the intersection and union of two rectangles, providing practical tools for users interested in exploring concepts related to shapes and space. The software is developed in Java using the Java Swing library, ensuring an interactive and responsive interface suitable for a wide range of graphical projects.
