I developed an application using IntelliJ and Scene Builder that presents a list of birds, along with detailed information for the selected bird.  Users can browse a comprehensive list of bird species. Upon selecting a bird, the application displays detailed information, such as its common and scientific names, habitat, diet, and distinctive features.

Using JavaFX, I created an interactive layout that connects the list view to a detailed view pane. The list is populated with bird names, and when a user clicks on a particular bird, the details are dynamically loaded in a separate section. This approach improves navigation and provides a seamless experience for users exploring different bird species.

IntelliJ was used for the project structure and code management, while Scene Builder helped design and refine the UI elements. The combination of these tools allowed me to focus on creating an intuitive user experience with clear data visualization.
